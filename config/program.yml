# Program mode configuration

 # This can be either "login" for the normal mode, or "reset" to do a password reset then bruteforce codes.
programMode: ""

# This can be "normal" for 6 digit OTP codes that change every 30 seconds, or "backup" for 8 digit alphanumeric codes (that take quite more time.)
# There are 10^6 possible "normal" codes, and 36^8 possible "backup" codes.
# While the normal codes change every 30 seconds (i.e the code that might not work now, may have worked 1 second after we entered it because it was on the 30 second interval),
# It's still a good bet to use them because bruteforcing 36^8 possible codes could take more time than the heat death of the universe.
